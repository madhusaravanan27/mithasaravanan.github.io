        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The Real Time Sports Analytic Platform is a distributed data pipeline designed to process a live lacrosse game stream, update player and team statistics, and generate live box scores for web developers. This system integrates various technologies, including PySpark, MongoDB, Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL), and Minio (S3-compatible storage), to simulate a real-world sports analytics environment.

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>PySpark</strong>: For distributed data processing and transformations.</li>
            <li><strong>MongoDB</strong>: NoSQL database for storing real-time box scores.</li>
            <li><strong>Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)</strong>: For storing team and player reference data.</li>
            <li><strong>Minio</strong>: S3-compatible object storage for live game stream data.</li>
            <li><strong>Apache Drill</strong>: Distributed SQL query engine for querying integrated datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Jupyter Lab</strong>: For developing and running PySpark code.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Accomplishments</h2>

        <h3>1. Real-Time Data Stream Processing</h3>
        <p>
            Developed a pipeline to ingest a live game stream from an S3 bucket (Minio) containing shot events and goals during a lacrosse game. Using PySpark, the pipeline tracks player shots, goals, and team scores as the game progresses.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Box Score Generation</h3>
        <p>
            Created a live box score updated in real-time, transforming game events into a JSON format suitable for web display. The box score is updated periodically during the game and stored in MongoDB for quick access by web developers, featuring player and team statistics such as shots taken, goals scored, and current game status.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Player and Team Statistics Update</h3>
        <p>
            After the game concludes, the pipeline updates the team win/loss records and player statistics in new MSSQL tables (players2 and teams2) to reflect final game results. PySpark is used to calculate cumulative shots and goals, ensuring accurate reflection of game outcomes in the database.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Database Integration and Querying</h3>
        <p>
            Integrated Apache Drill to query across distributed datasets from MSSQL, MongoDB, and Minio. Wrote SQL queries in Apache Drill to retrieve and display data on teams, players, and the live game stream for in-depth analytics and reporting.
        </p>

        <h3>5. End-to-End Data Pipeline</h3>
        <p>
            Combined all components into a comprehensive PySpark script to automate the entire process: ingesting the game stream, updating statistics, generating live box scores, and finalizing stats post-game. This ensures the pipeline runs consistently during the game, providing web developers with up-to-date statistics as the game progresses.
