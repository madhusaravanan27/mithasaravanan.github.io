        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s degree in Applied Data Science at the School of Information Studies, Syracuse University, specializing in two tracks: Data Platforms and Pipelines, and Big Data Analytics. The Data Platforms and Pipelines track includes advanced coursework in Data Warehousing and Data Management, equipping me with skills to design and manage efficient data storage solutions. In the Big Data Analytics track, I have engaged in courses like Advanced Big Data Management and Big Data Analytics, focusing on processing, analyzing, and extracting insights from large datasets.</p>

        <p>My academic journey has also included comprehensive training in areas such as Machine Learning, Quantitative Reasoning, Cloud Management, and Natural Language Processing. These courses have provided a strong foundation in data science methodologies, cloud computing, and advanced analytical techniques, enhancing my ability to work with diverse data environments and tools.</p>

        <p>Originally from Chennai, India, I completed my undergraduate studies in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Meenakshi Sundararajan Engineering College, affiliated with Anna University. This background has given me a solid grounding in programming, data structures, and engineering principles, all of which support my current focus on data science and analytics.</p>

        <p>Driven by a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights, I am eager to leverage my knowledge and skills to solve complex problems and contribute to data-driven decision-making in real-world applications.</p>
